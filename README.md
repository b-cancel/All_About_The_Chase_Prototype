# All_About_The_Chase_Prototype

Created as a Prototype to "Itzo". 
<br>
Map Generation with JSON files, and uses the "Pairing Kit" to store the move information for each tile.
<br>
Massive Bug: when not map you might collide into invisible walls even though they are not really coded to be there. This might be because of a broken pairing kit. I will repair it soon.
